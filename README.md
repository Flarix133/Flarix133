## Hi there ğŸ‘‹
My name is Thomas, I often go by the moniker Flarix.
After 10 years in the Navy and doing labor jobs after, I decided to start college. I've been interested in computers since I was a teen.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my associates in CS and getting my life together.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning and understanding the intrecacies of the computer world, and how to socially interact as a veteran of the Navy.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about philosophy, science, and dark humor.
- âš¡ Fun fact: military grade means it meets the bare minimum requirements and is often more expensive for no reason.
